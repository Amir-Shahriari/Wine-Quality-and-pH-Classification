## Overview

The **Wine Quality Check** project explores a dataset of wine samples to:

- Clean and preprocess data for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between chemical properties and wine quality.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict wine quality.
- Derive actionable insights for improving wine production.

This project serves as a practical introduction to data science and machine learning, with applications in the food and beverage industry.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.


## Project Description

The **Wine Quality Check** notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Normalize or scale features for optimal model performance.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze correlations between features and wine quality.
   - Visualize data using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
3. **Model Building**:
   - Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Provide suggestions for optimizing wine quality based on model findings.

### Applications

- Quality control in wine production.
- Data-driven decision-making for product development.
- Educational tool for learning data science and machine learning.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries (listed in the notebook)

## How to Use
